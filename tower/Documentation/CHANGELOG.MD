## Version history

My versioning probably needs work. Each part has its own versions and the assembly as a whole has its own.

Version 8 (not produced) changes:
- Reduced the size of the bottom of `bracket-tower` since Version 2 was impacting the forks.
- Added a rotational slot near the primary light mount to allow for the second mounting point for Baja Design's LP4.
- NOTE: This version has not been produced/manufactured, but the changes are minor tweaks.

Version 7 (produced) changes:
- Added an additional attachment point between the frame and the tower. This was done to minimize shaking and prevent rotation around the (previously) single-point of attachement. The inner bracket is much larger to facilitate this.
- Adjusted the placement of the hole that provided the attachment point for the struts to which the side panels bolted onto. This was also made into a slot to facilitate variance and error tolerance since the inner bracket's increased size adds significant cost.
- Increased the diameter of this hole to facilitate an M8 bolt (from M6).
- Changed the hole for the bottom light to a slot for additional adjustment.
- Brought the leading edge of the outer bracket inward. The side panels were slightly impacting this leading edge.
- Extended the outer bracket downwards and added an additional hole to accommodate another strut to support the side panels at another attachment point. This position has not be verified.
- Altered the auxiliary bracket to accommodate two switches in addition to a standard cigarette lighter.
- Comparison of v06 and v07 [Tower Brackets](../images/production/misc/bracket-tower_comparison.jpg) and [Support Brackets]z(../images/production/misc/bracket-support_comparison.jpg).

Version 6 (produced) changes:
- Initial version
