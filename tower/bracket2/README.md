# bracket2

![bracket2](images/bracket2-complete.jpg)

This bracket replaces Yamaha part BW3-2831V-10-00.

## Overview
This bracket attaches to the steering head (two left-most bolts) and provides support for the tower (right-most hole). This design retrains the two holes (centered) that the OEM headlight attach to. These are retained because many crash bars use this as a mounting point.

The OEM bolts that attach the bracket to the steering head are reused.

## Distances
Spacing between the outer faces of both brackets is 27mm. The inner spacing is 21mm.
