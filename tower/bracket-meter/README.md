# bracket-meter
This bracket replaces Yamaha part BW3-F834L-00-00.

## Considerations
- This should be made approximately 3mm thick to accommodate the OEM grommets.
- The cable from the display meter sticks out the back about 25mm. Because of this, spacers might be required depending on where this is mounted.

## Necessary hardware
Some spacers/washers may be required to mount at the OEM location.
