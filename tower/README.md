# Tenere 700 Rally Tower

This is a rally-style tower build for the Tenere 700.

## Overview

The tower is designed to provide a lightweight alternative to the Tenere's dash by replacing the following components:
- Headlight
- Headlight stay
- Display meter mount

## Components
The requirement components are largely broken down into three catagories
### Brackets
These are the custom-fabricated parts that are used to support the meter and navigation device. The design uses 3mm carbon fiber, but another material could be used instead. Currently there are three unique bracket designs:
#### bracket2
This is a small bracket that replaces the Yamaha OEM part BW3-2831V-10-00, which joins the bottom of the headlight to the steering head. The OEM version of this bracket can bend, causing the whole headlight assembly to be askew until replaced or straightened out.
#### bracket3
This is the main component of the tower. It bolts on to `bracket2` and extends upward to mate with the OEM GPS bar. Two of these sheets essentially sandwich one or two aftermarket headlights as well as `bracket-meter`.
#### bracket-meter
This provides support for the Tenere's OEM display/meter. Three larger holes support the grommets that the meter mates with, and then a few sets of holes allow it to bolt onto `bracket3` with a separate, 90 degree bracket. There are also holes in the AMPS pattern and M8 holes at 100mm x 40mm spacing to accommodate mounting onto the handlebar clamps. 
### Lights
The intent is to accommodate aftermarket lights that mount on either side. There is 121.5mm of spacing to accommodate various-sized lights. This is currently being designed with the Baja Designs Squadron Pro lights in mind.
### Hardware
This includes all necessary fasteners and other hardware required to mount all of the above. Hardware is sourced from McMaster-Carr in order to have an accessible baseline.
