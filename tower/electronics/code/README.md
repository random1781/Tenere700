# Source Code

This is the abortion that is currently running on the RP2040 that somehow provides the functionality that I need.

The intent was to structure it to support more complicated operations, but currently it displays an adjustable trip meter, the GPS's odometer, and heading. Cleaning this up and improving it is my next project now that all the hardware has been finailzed and installed.

I'm learning C as I go, and I definitely got help from ChatGPT.
