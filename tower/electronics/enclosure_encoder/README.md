## Mounting

This mounts to the [bar clamp made by HDB](https://hdboffroad.com/product/ultimate-hand-guard-yamaha-tenere-700/).

The rotary encoders are strongly soldered onto the board. Because of this, the encoders themselves are bolted to the [Enclosure lid](enclosure_encoder_lid) with o-rings to stem water ingress. The [Enclosure base](enclosure_encoder_base) has mounting posts for the I2C Terminator.
