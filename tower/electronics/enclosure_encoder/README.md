- [Enclosure base](enclosure_encoder_base) - Includes mounting posts for: 
  - [I2C Active Terminator](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4756)
- [Enclosure lid](enclosure_encoder_lid) - Includes cutouts to mount:
  - [NeoRotary 4](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5752)

## Mounting

This mounts to the [bar clamp made by HDB](https://hdboffroad.com/product/ultimate-hand-guard-yamaha-tenere-700/).

The rotary encoders are strongly soldered onto the board. Because of this, the encoders themselves are bolted to the [Enclosure lid](enclosure_encoder_lid) with o-rings to stem water ingress. The [Enclosure base](enclosure_encoder_base) has mounting posts for the I2C Terminator.
