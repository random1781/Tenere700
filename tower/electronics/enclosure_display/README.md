![Display Enclosure](../images/enclosure_display_exploded.png)

## Components

Enclosure for display components:
- [Enclosure base](enclosure_display_base)
  - [Seven segment backpack and displays](https://www.adafruit.com/product/878)
  - [NeoPixel Stick 8](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1426)
- [Enclosure lid](enclosure_display_lid)
- [Enclosure gasket](enclosure_display_gasket)
- [Lens](enclosure_display_lens)

Mounting brackets:
- [Bracket Display](bracket_display)
- [Bracket Antenna](bracket_antenna)

## Mounting

The entire assembly mounts via [Bracket Antenna](bracket_antenna), which has a 12mm post that gets clamped by the same AMPS mounting block that is attached to the Tenere's GPS bar.

[Bracket Display](bracket_display) is held in place underneath [Bracket Antenna](bracket_antenna) by the bolts that mount the antenna itself to the its bracket.

The display enclosure is then bolted on to the [Bracket Display](bracket_display).

Because the diameter of the 12mm post might vary slightly, a bit of tape wrapped around it can add diameter if it winds up being too loose.
