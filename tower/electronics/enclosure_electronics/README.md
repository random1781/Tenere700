## Mounting

There is one post to bolt onto the tower itself along with guides for a [Voile strap](https://www.voile.com/voile-straps.html) or similar. In practice, just one strap works fine to mount.

## Cable cutouts

There is one cutout on top and two on the bottom for cables to pass through. The one on the top is a bit short and required some filing to allow all the cables to pass through. I used a copious amount of silicone to seal all the cutouts after the cables were run.
