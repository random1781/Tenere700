# Joints

The joints connect the panels with each other along their edges.

## Fabrication Notes

**Recommended material:** Stainless steel
**Recommended gauge:** 22 gauge / 0.8mm
**Bend angles:**
`joint-base-side-left-v01`: 65 degrees
`joint-base-side-right-v01`: 65 degrees
`joint-front-left-v01.ai`: 96 degrees
`joint-front-right-v01.ai`: 96 degrees
`joint-rear-side-left-v01.ai`: 78 degrees
`joint-rear-side-right-v01.ai`: 78 degrees
`joint-rear-bottom-v01.ai`: 60 degrees
**Bend direction:** ALL down or ALL up

If bent via SendCutSend, there will be some deformation of the holes closest to the bend. I believe this will *not* be significant enough to matter, but I have not confirmed this to be the case.
