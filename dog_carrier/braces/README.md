# Braces

The braces provide rigidity and are essentially a frame from the entire assembly.

## Fabrication Notes

**Recommended material:** Angle aluminum

**Recommended gauge:** 1/8" thick, 3/4" legs

**Bend angles:** 90 degrees

**Bend direction:** ALL down or ALL up

**tab-v01**: This part has two bends: 150 and 155 degrees. Since this part is mirrored, add this part twice, but swap **either** the bend angles or the bend direction.

If bent via SendCutSend, there will be significant deformation of the holes closest to the bend. Some deformation is acceptable, but I can't confirm how much there will be and whether this will have a negative effect on the produced part. Your options are to:
 - Proceed with the deformation
 - Remove the holes nearest to the bend and drill them yourself when you receive the part
 - Use 90 degree angle from the hardware store and cut/drill it yourself
