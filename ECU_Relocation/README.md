# ECU Relocation

This is a support for the ECU to be relocated from the side of the frame to just over the battery. It consists of:

- [Base](cad/v01/battery_topper-v01.stl) - the main support for the ECU that mounts to the battery via the battery's strap
- [Wedge](cad/v01/wedge-v01.stl) - because the ECU is "upside down" with the flat side up, this provides support to the non-flat side facing the battery

## Important Notes

The current model needs some revisions!

- The support on the left side impacts the starter relay (I think it's the starter relay) and needs to be trimmed down significantly.
- There isn't much space to reach in and hook the strap up. Some of that area needs to be trimmed off - this doesn't need THAT much support.
- There is a notch on the bottom towards the front of the motorcycle. This is to help keep it in place, but I added this specifically for a [Motobatt battery](https://www.motobatt.us/MBTZ10S-Motobatt-12V-Battery_2). This probably needs to be removed to use with the OEM battery.
