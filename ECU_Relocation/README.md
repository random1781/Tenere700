# ECU Relocation

This is a support for the ECU to be relocated from the side of the frame to just over the battery. It consists of:

- [Base]() - the main support for the ECU that mounts to the battery via the battery's strap
- [Wedge]() - because the ECU is "upside down" with the flat side up, this provides support to the non-flat side facing the battery
