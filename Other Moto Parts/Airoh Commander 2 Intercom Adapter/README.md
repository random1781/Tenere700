# Airoh Commander 2 Intercom Adapter

The curves on this helmet's shell make stick-on intercom plates a bit tedious to stick on.

The Cardo Edge's mount has a curve to fit the curve of normal helmets. For ease of printing and to allow for making adapters for other headsets, this is split into two pieces:

- [cad/flat-helmet-v02b.STL](Helmet -> flat surface)
- [cad/flat-airoh_commander_2-v02b.STL](Flat surface -> Cardo Edge mount curve)
